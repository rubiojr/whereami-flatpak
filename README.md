# Building whereami as a Flatpak

This directory contains the Flatpak manifest and related files for building `whereami` as a Flatpak application.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to build and install the Flatpak is using the Makefile targets from the project root:

```bash
# Build and install the Flatpak (user installation)
make flatpak-install

# Run the installed Flatpak
make flatpak-run

# Clean build artifacts
make flatpak-clean

# Rebuild from scratch
make flatpak-rebuild
```

## Prerequisites

Before building, ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
# Add the Flathub repository if you haven't already
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# Install the KDE Platform and SDK (version 6.9)
flatpak install flathub org.kde.Platform//6.9 org.kde.Sdk//6.9

# The Golang SDK extension should already be available
# but you can verify with:
flatpak list | grep golang
```

### Local Development Builds

The manifest uses a `git` source which fetches from GitHub. For local development with uncommitted changes, you can temporarily change the source to use a local directory:

```yaml
# In io.github.rubiojr.whereami.yml, replace the git source with:
sources:
  - type: dir
    path: ..
  - type: file
    path: modules.txt
  - go.mod.json
```

**Important**: Don't commit this change! The `type: git` source is required for distribution (e.g., Flathub).

## Files in this Directory

- **`io.github.rubiojr.whereami.yml`** - The Flatpak manifest that defines how to build the application
- **`go.mod.json`** - Pre-generated Go module sources for offline building (no network access needed during build)
- **`README.md`** - This file

## How It Works

The Flatpak build process:

1. **Downloads Go modules offline** - The `go.mod.json` file contains pre-downloaded URLs for all Go dependencies, so the build doesn't require network access during compilation
2. **Builds `miqt-rcc`** - First builds the Qt resource compiler tool needed for QML resources
3. **Generates resources** - Runs `go generate` to compile QML files into the binary
4. **Builds the application** - Compiles the Go application with vendored dependencies
5. **Installs desktop integration** - Installs the `.desktop` file and application icon

## Updating Go Dependencies

If you add or update Go dependencies, regenerate the `go.mod.json` and `modules.txt` files:

```bash
# From project root
go install github.com/dennwc/flatpak-go-mod@latest

# Generate the flatpak sources (this creates both go.mod.json and modules.txt)
flatpak-go-mod -json -out flatpak

# Or if running from flatpak/ directory:
cd flatpak
flatpak-go-mod -json
```

**Note**: The `flatpak-go-mod` tool generates two files:
- `go.mod.json` - Archive sources for all Go dependencies
- `modules.txt` - The Go vendor modules list

Both files must be regenerated together whenever dependencies change.

## Permissions

The Flatpak has the following permissions:

- **Graphics**: Wayland and X11 (fallback) support
- **Network**: Required for downloading map tiles
- **Location services**: Access to GeoClue2 for device location
- **Filesystem**: Can create/write to `~/Documents/whereami/` for bookmarks

These are defined in the `finish-args` section of the manifest.

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't find ref..." error**
- Ensure you have installed the correct KDE Platform/SDK version (6.9)
- Run: `flatpak list | grep org.kde`

**Build failures with "rcc not found"**
- This should be handled automatically by the manifest
- The Qt `rcc` tool is in `/usr/libexec/rcc` within the KDE SDK

**Permission denied on rofiles-fuse**
- Clean up stale mount points: `flatpak-builder --force-clean build-dir io.github.rubiojr.whereami.yml`
- Or use the make target: `make flatpak-clean && make flatpak-install`

**Go module download errors**
- The build should work offline using `go.mod.json`
- If you see download errors, the `go.mod.json` may be outdated - regenerate it

## Development Workflow

When developing and testing Flatpak changes:

```bash
# 1. Make changes to source code or manifest
# 2. Rebuild and install
make flatpak-rebuild

# 3. Test the application
make flatpak-run

# 4. Check logs if needed
flatpak run --command=sh io.github.rubiojr.whereami
```

## Uninstalling

To remove the installed Flatpak:

```bash
flatpak uninstall --user io.github.rubiojr.whereami
```

To also remove build artifacts:

```bash
make flatpak-clean
```
